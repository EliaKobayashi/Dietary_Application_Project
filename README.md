# Unit 3 Project: PFC Application Documentation

![](Screen Shot 2022-02-24 at 22.44.08.png)

## Criteria A: Planning

### Problem Definition:
 
The client for this project is Kojiro Matsumoto. He is interested in keeping account of his nutrients intake per meal. Specifically, the intake of protein, fat, and calories. Due to this, he would like an application that would allow him to keep track of his protein, fat, and calories intake per day.

### Success Criteria:

1. The application should have a log in system.
2. The application should have a sign up system.
3. The passwords of users should be encoded in a secure manner.
4. After the user logs in, the user should be able to pick whether they want to log their PFC intake (protein, fat and calories) or monitor their PFC intakes.
5. To monitor PFC intakes, a calendar will be displayed. When users click on a date, the PFC intakes will be displayed.
6. The application should include cartoon drawings of food for asthetic purposes.

### Design Statement

I will design and make an application for a client who is interested in keeping track of his protein, fat, and calories intakes per day. The application will allow the client to log in, log their PFC (protein, fat, and calories) intakes, and monitor their PFC intakes per day. Additionally, the log in system will ensure passwords to be encoded and secure. The application will be constructed using Pycharm, the Python language, and the KivyMD Language. This project will take 4 weeks and will be evaluated according to the criteria set above.

### Rationale for Proposed Solution

For the application, we will be using the Python language, as according to CodingNomads, is the most used language used coding language in the world and the langauge I am most comfortable with. If I were to use another language, I would have to learn the new language, slowing the process of creating the application. Therefore, using Python is the best for this project. The library I will be using is KivyMD. KivyMD is a library that can be used with Python. According to Analytics Vidhya, KivyMD is extremely easy to use. Therefore, learning the functions of it will not take long. Furthermore, it facilitates cross-platform applications that can run on Windows, Linux, Android, OSX, IOS, and Rasberry Pi as well. Due to its versatilities, I will be using KivyMD instead of Libavg or PyQT.

### Details

When first opening the application, a log in or sign up option will be displayed. There will be cartoon drawings of nutritious foods as decorations. Once signed up, an option to log the PFC intakes or monitor the PFC will be displayed. If you were to log the PFC intakes, there will be three white boxes where you input the protein, fat, and calories intakes. If you were to monitor the PFC intakes, a calendar with dates will appear. Once clicking on a date, the PFC intakes of that particular date will be displayed.
